# Code

This directory contains source code for utilities that might be useful for parsing and viewing the Matterport3D data set.   

## gaps
A C++ software framework with libraries for general-purpose processing of 3D data (in the pkgs subdirectory) and an application for parsing, processing, and viewing Matterport3D data (in apps/mpview).   See [gaps](gaps/README.txt) for more information about the GAPS software and [mpview](gaps/apps/mpview/README.md) for information about the C++ code for parsing and viewing Matterport3D files.

## PanoBasic
We used the PanoBasic MATLAB toolbox to generate panorama images from the color and depth frames.  Please see https://github.com/yindaz/PanoBasic for more information.
